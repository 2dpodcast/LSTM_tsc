An LSTM is the extension of the classical Recurrent Neural Network. It has more flexibility and interpretable features such as a memory it can read, write and forget.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\nOver the last months, I ran into many LSTM's for sequence-to-sequence modelling. That is also where the code base for this projects comes from. I didn't find any implementations for LSTM's for classification of time-series. \r\nInspired by a paper by Zhicheng Cui in 2016 on ArXiv and information on [this](http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data/) website, I decided to make my own.\r\n\r\n## First stage\r\nThe implementation can be improved in many ways. For now, the code works on a self-made dataset containing sinusoids and a dataset from the [UCR archive](http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data/) named TwoPatterns. I heavily equipped the code with histograms, plots and visualizations to track the training procedure. I hope this enables you to get a feeling for the LSTM and to employ it on your own dataset.\r\nMoreover, I included many comments to explain the workflow of the code. I hope it also enables people unfamiliar to Tensorflow to start working with LSTM's.\r\n\r\n### Results\r\nThe code is equipped with many TensorBoard diagrams, so you can follow your training:\r\n![TensorBoard_diagrams](https://github.com/RobRomijnders/LSTM_tsc/blob/master/progress/tb_for_github_io.png?raw=true)\r\nRunning the code without any changes will result in a diagram like this:\r\n![loss_acc_diagram](https://github.com/RobRomijnders/LSTM_tsc/blob/master/progress/loss_acc_for_github_io.png?raw=true)\r\nAnd after many iterations, it may look like this:\r\n![loss_acc_diagram_long](https://github.com/RobRomijnders/LSTM_tsc/blob/master/progress/160405_01.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\nCredits for this project go to [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.7/tutorials/recurrent/index.html#recurrent-neural-networks) for providing a strong example, the [UCR archive](http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data/) for the dataset and my friend Ryan for strong feedback.\r\n\r\nAs always, I am curious to any comments and questions.
